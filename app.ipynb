      "Scrum Masters are accountable for establishing Scrum as defined in the Scrum Guide. They do this by helping everyone understand Scrum theory and practice, both within the Scrum Team and the organization. The Scrum Master is a true leader who serves the Scrum Team and the larger organization. They serve the Scrum Team in several ways, including coaching the team members in self-management and cross-functionality; causing the removal of impediments to the Scrum Teamâ€™s progress; and ensuring that all Scrum events take place and are positive, productive, and kept within the timebox. The Scrum Master serves the organization in several ways, including leading, training, and coaching the organization in its Scrum adoption. Planning and advising Scrum implementations within the organization. Helping employees and stakeholders understand and enact an empirical approach for complex work.
